# DFS-NoAmbience
- This resource requires DFS https://github.com/DarkFeather-Studios/fivem_framework
- This resource requires DFS_Stats, but this dependency can be removed in under an hour. https://github.com/DarkFeather-Studios/dfsstats

This resource does exactly what it's name says it does, plus more. 
- It removes certain ambient effects (see: ambient sirens)
- Provides time and weather sync plus commands (/settime and /setweather)
- disables non-RP HUD articles
- disables natural health regen
- enables random trains (That can be ridden!)
- Disables one shot kills
- Alters the time which stunguns keep you down for
- Prevents peds from automatically putting on motorcycle helmets when riding a motorcycle
- Adjusts the ped, vehicle, wildlife, and parked vehicle desnities
- Prevents pistolwhipping
- Disables idle cameras
- Disables players getting weapons from police vehicles, cash from bank trucks, etc
- Causes car crashes to actually hurt based on the vehicles speeds (the player, of course.)
- Provides a banlist for cars (This should be updated eventually to use the server-side standard instead of the client side.)
- Provides the ability to alter vehicle handling without messing with the handling.meta files
- Gives players infinite stamina (never slow down randomly)

Each of these modules can be altrered or disabled with ease.
